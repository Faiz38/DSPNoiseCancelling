# Digital Signal Processing for Audio Noise Filtering

Welcome to the Audio Processing Showcase repository! This repository contains a MATLAB script that demonstrates various audio processing techniques applied to a noisy audio sample. The script showcases visualization and analysis in both time and frequency domains, as well as filtering, spectrogram generation, and cross-correlation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
3. Open the MATLAB script `audio_processing.m` to explore the code.

## Highlights

- Load and play a noisy audio sample.
- Visualize the frequency domain of the audio signal.
- Plot the audio waveform in the time domain.
- Generate a spectrogram for visualizing audio characteristics.
- Apply a Butterworth filter to remove noise.
- Compare time and frequency domain before and after filtering.
- Visualize expected result in the time domain.
- Calculate Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for another signal.
- Perform cross-correlation analysis on two audio signals.

## Usage

Feel free to modify and experiment with the MATLAB script to learn more about audio processing techniques. Use your own audio samples to explore the effects of different processing steps.
